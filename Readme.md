#### repo for plots & figures

In this repository the plots made for different purposes are stored as images and scripts.  
The data are not mine. Visualizations for the data from the [Pushkin House Dataverse](https://dataverse.pushdom.ru) are stored in *PD_dataverse*.   
The plots are mostly inspired by *TidyTuesday* and [The R Graph Gallery](https://www.r-graph-gallery.com/index.html) & are made with the help of ```tidyverse``` and ```ggplot2``` packages.
